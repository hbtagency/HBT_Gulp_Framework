Regarding Development Environment: 
  
The interview solution is set up with Gulp + SASS + Angular. 
I know there were heaps of better task builders frameworks eg: https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular, which takes bit process of installation.
So I choose to write a simple one and hope that's easier for the question examiner. 

How to install: 
1. Please put source code under a server www folder(wamp), and create a subfolder "property_list"
2. In "$server/www/property_list/" start a command console and run "npm install" (with administrator permission in windows)
3. In "$server/www/property_list/" run "gulp" to start the project.

Regarding Folder Structure: 
    root
         - css
           -- bootstrap
           -- cache
           -- final
           -- fonts
           -- project
         - js
           -- angular
           -- bootstrap
           -- cache
           -- final
           -- jquery
           -- project
     index.html

Gulp will minify and concat css(SCSS to CSS first) and js in proper order, and per modification to any files under project folder, index.html will reload by "BrowserSync"
which is pretty standard process of script preprocessing. 
Regarding AngularJs, it is Angular 1 which came first to my head as a straigh solution. I was trying to play more with ES6 or Typescript, but as I stuck with setting 
it up with Gulp, and my holiday is mostly occupied with travelling plans, so I just hand in what I most familiar this time. 

Regarding Testing: 

I could brief my basic ideas whic are: 
1. Unit test(Jasmine or other) against anular controller methods.
2. Behavior test to similate functional logic, which should cover: 

     1> See all available properties listed out
     2> See see corresponding content of property items are correct to the backend. 
     3> Click add a property to saved list should see corresponding property be added to the saved list on right hand column.
     4> Click to add a different property should see corresponding property be added to the saved list on right hand column.
     5> Click to add a same property as step 3 did should not see corresponding item be added twice and should be with no exceptions. 
     6> Add a third property to saved list. 
     7> Remove the second item in saved list should not see anyothers affected. 
     8> Re-insert second property should see it is ordered as default in the 3rd place in saved list column. 
     9> Remove all saved property item one by one should see right column disappear, rather than showing a blank box. 

Regarding Cusomized Code: 
Please find my solutions in propertyController.js, and it is taking and saving values just within object($scope). 
But let me know if it is required to include real database, so I could set up a angular service and implement ajax or interaction with mongo DB or firebase.
